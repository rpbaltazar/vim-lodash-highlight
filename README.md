# vim-lodash-highlight
Simple highlight extender for coffee script that highlight of existing methods of lodash library as functions.

Currently matching against v3.8.0 of lodash.

As lodash is a "drop-in" solution to replace underscore, this should work as well in most of the methods made available by it.

There are some methods that might not be properly highlighted.

This extender, as the noun means, is an extension to an existing syntax highlighter for coffee and therefore installed on after/syntax/coffee.vim
